# Code reviews

This repo contains coding challenges that I have done whilst being assessed by independent professional reviewers from [CoGrammar](https://www.cogrammar.com/). They are designed to emulate the process one might expect in a live tech test for a formal job application.

All have been conducted under a strict time limit of less than 1 hour, with the assessor looking for demonstration of:
- SOLID principles
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Good communication
- Efficient process
- Recognition of suitable edge cases

The table below outlines those I have completed to date - in reverse chronological order so you can see my progress over time. Please click on one of the exercises or recording/feedback links for more detail.
